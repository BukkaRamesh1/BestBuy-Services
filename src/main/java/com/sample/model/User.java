 *   a big application made into serveral small apploications to produce/deliver the work fastly, independely, and load balancing the traffic od applications
 *   
 *   
 *   Java 8 
 *   features 
 *   Lambda expression, stream API, data time api, functional interface.
 *   
 *   best but is a one application -- if we develop in old way of process // standalone or monoloythic application we say 
 *   
 *   API Gateway --  with asyncronous calls parllel processing of data we are going to use kafka services -- 
 *   Cloud Config server  -- one point access 
 *   Hystrix Dashboard -- to moinitor multiple services health 
 *   zipkin and sleuth -- log trace   it will log all your logger
 *   Git repo -- multiple services
